The values shown may have been processed, reformatted, or converted for use within the App. While great care has been taken to maintain accuracy, occasional errors or discrepancies may still occur. If you rely on a particular value for medical, dietary, or specialist purposes, please check it against the original source.</p>",
        "<p class=\"mb-4\">Nutrient values in published datasets represent typical averages and may not reflect every food item, brand, or preparation method. Because the App performs calculations, conversions, and classification steps, there is a small possibility of translation or processing errors. For sensitive or clinical use, primary sources should always be considered authoritative.</p>",
